ssrv lets you quickly create custom web pages using a simple yaml instructions. No programming needed :)

With ssrv, you can do the following:
- custom response headers
- any content length
- status code of your choice
- custom response body

It can help you in bug bounties for example, if you'd want to test for SSRF but the host expects certain type of response.
